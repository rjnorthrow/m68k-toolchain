# m68k-toolchain
Toolchains for building m68k on x86_64

There are two toolchains created, m68k-elf and m68k-amigaos

This was created for [rjnorthrow/atk](https://github.com/rjnorthrow/atk) but can be used for other purposes

The executables can be found in `/cross/bin` so put this in your `$PATH`

Also in this path can be found `vasmm68k_mot`, `vlink` and `vobjdump` executables
